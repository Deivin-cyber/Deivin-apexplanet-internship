## 🎯 Objective
Demonstrate fundamental cybersecurity operations in a lab environment, including:

- Reconnaissance (Passive & Active)  
- Port & Service Scanning  
- Vulnerability Assessment  
- Packet Analysis  
- Firewall Configuration

## 💻 Lab Setup
| Component        | Details           |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Attacker VM      | Kali Linux       |
| Target VM        | Metasploitable2  |
| Network          | Host-only        |

## 🗂️ Tasks & Methodology

### 1️⃣ Reconnaissance
- **Passive Recon:** Whois, Nslookup, Google Dorking, Shodan  
- **Active Recon:** Ping Sweep, Banner Grabbing  

### 2️⃣ Port & Service Scanning
- Nmap TCP & UDP Scans  
- Service Version Detection (`-sV`)  
- OS Detection (`-O`)  


### 3️⃣ Vulnerability Scanning
- Nessus Essentials used for scanning  
  

### 4️⃣ Packet Analysis
- Captured HTTP, FTP, DNS traffic  
- Filtered credentials from unencrypted FTP  
  

### 5️⃣ Firewall Basics
- Configured `iptables` rules to allow/deny specific ports  
- Demonstrated blocking a port scan attempt  
- Files stored in `/firewall/`

## 📦 Deliverables
- Nmap Scan Report (`/Nmap Scan Report.pdf`)  
- Nessus/OpenVAS Vulnerability Report (`/Nessus Report.pdf`)  
- Firewall rules and demonstration  
- Demo Video (local file)

## 📊 Observations & Learning
- Identified open ports and running services on the target  
- Detected vulnerabilities and classified by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)  
- Extracted sensitive data from unencrypted traffic (FTP, HTTP)  
- Tested firewall rules to block unauthorized access and port scans  
- Learned practical application of scanning and monitoring techniques in a lab environment  

---

## ⚡ Notes
- All experiments conducted in a safe, isolated host-only lab environment  
- No sensitive or personal data exposed
